# DistributedFractals

**DistributedFractals** is a command-line application for rendering fractals (e.g., Mandelbrot and Julia sets) using CPU-based parallelism with MPI. It enables high-resolution image generation across multiple processing units, making it suitable for both local and distributed rendering setups.

## üöÄ Overview

This project explores the intersection of fractal rendering and distributed computing using the [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](https://www.mpi-forum.org/). The main goals are:

- Efficiently generate complex fractal images using CPU parallelism.
- Compare performance between sequential and distributed rendering.
- Provide flexibility via a command-line interface for full customization.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

To compile the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
### Parallel (MPI) Execution

To run the distributed version with 8 processes:
```bash
mpirun -np 8 ./fractal_mpi
```
### Sequential Version
A non-MPI version is also available:
```bash
./sequential
```

## Output mode
After the image is generated, the program can output at the following modes:
- **Disk**: Stores the generated image in the specified output filepath
- **Network**: Connects to a remote server and sends the generated *.png* image buffer through TCP. Note that this involves a sever. A simple implementation of this server is located at `src/scripts/image_server.py`


## ‚öôÔ∏è Command-Line Arguments

| `--color_mode <int>`       | Color mode ID                                              |

## Interactive visualizer
A simple interactive visualizer is also included, built using Python and Pygame. This viewer allows users to explore the fractal image by zooming into selected regions. It accepts the same command-line arguments as the fractal renderer and passes them directly to the compiled executable. Therefore, make sure the renderer has already been built before running the visualizer.

### Setup
Creating python virtual environment
```bash
cd src/scripts
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Installing pygame
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running
```bash
python3 ./interactive_visualizer.py
```

You can also specify the number of mpi processors with argument `--np <x>` and the rendering executable path `--executable_path <path>`.
